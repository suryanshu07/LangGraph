# LangGraph  
**Building Modular AI Workflows with LangGraph and Groq’s LLaMA-3**  

When working with large language models, most people think in terms of **simple prompts and responses**.  
But what if we want to:  
- **Orchestrate multiple steps**  
- **Combine different functions**  
- **Make AI systems modular and visualizable**  

That’s where **LangGraph** comes in.

## 🚀 Why LangGraph?  
LangGraph provides a way to **treat your AI pipeline as a graph**:  
- **Nodes** → individual tasks (like calling a model or transforming data)  
- **Edges** → define how the output of one task flows into another  

This makes workflows:  
- **Composable** → easy to extend or swap steps  
- **Transparent** → you can visualize the flow  
- **Reusable** → each node is independent and testable

## 🛠️ My Workflow  
I built a simple but illustrative pipeline with **two stages**:  

1. **LLM Response Generation**  
   - Uses **Groq’s LLaMA-3 (70B)** to handle natural language queries.  
   - Produces **intelligent, context-aware responses**.  

2. **Post-Processing Transformation**  
   - After the LLM responds, the output flows into another node.  
   - In this example: it simply **converts text to uppercase**.  
   - But it could be extended to **sentiment analysis, entity extraction, or formatting**.  

👉 The two nodes are **connected**, so the LLM output directly feeds into the transformation.

## ⚡ Running the Workflow  
Once defined, the workflow behaves like an **app**:  
- **Entry point** → where input enters (the LLaMA-3 node).  
- **Finish point** → where output comes out (the transformation node).  
- Invoke the app with any query and **watch it flow through the pipeline**.  

**Example runs:**  
- Input: *“hi”* → Output: *LLM reply in UPPERCASE*  
- Input: *“Who was the first Prime Minister of India?”* → Output: *LLM’s factual answer in UPPERCASE*

## 🌟 Why This Matters  
This project is **more than a toy example**. It highlights:  
- How to **wrap LLMs inside modular, reusable components**  
- The power of **connecting AI tasks as a graph**, not just a chain  
- The ability to **visualize reasoning pipelines**, crucial as AI systems grow more complex

## 🔮 What’s Next?  
With this foundation, the workflow could be extended to:  
- **Multi-step reasoning agents**  
- **Data cleaning + summarization pipelines**  
- **Multi-model collaboration** (vision, text, and structured data together)
