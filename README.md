# LangGraph
Building Modular AI Workflows with LangGraph and Groq’s LLaMA-3.

When working with large language models, most people think in terms of simple prompts and responses. But what if we want to orchestrate multiple steps, combine different functions, and make our AI systems modular and visualizable?

That’s where LangGraph comes in.

Why LangGraph?

LangGraph provides a way to treat your AI pipeline as a graph — each node is a task (like calling a model or transforming data), and edges define how the output of one task flows into another. This makes your workflows:

Composable (easy to extend or swap steps)

Transparent (you can visualize the flow)

Reusable (each node is independent and testable)

My Workflow

I built a simple but illustrative pipeline with two stages:

LLM Response Generation

I used Groq’s implementation of LLaMA-3 (70B) to handle natural language queries.

This node is responsible for producing intelligent, context-aware responses.

Post-Processing Transformation

Running the Workflow

Once defined, the workflow behaves like an app:

You set an entry point (where input enters, here it’s the LLaMA-3 node).

You set a finish point (where final output comes out, here it’s the transformation node).

You can then invoke the app with any query and watch it flow through the pipeline.

Example runs:

Input: “hi” → Output: LLM reply in uppercase

Input: “Who was the first Prime Minister of India?” → Output: LLM’s factual answer in uppercase

Why This Matters

This project is more than a toy example. It highlights:

How to wrap LLMs inside modular, reusable components.

The power of connecting AI tasks as a graph, not just a chain.

The ability to visualize reasoning pipelines, which is crucial as AI systems grow more complex.

With this foundation, you could extend the workflow to:

Multi-step reasoning agents

Data cleaning + summarization pipelines

Multi-model collaboration (vision, text, and structured data together)


After the LLM answers, the output flows into another node that transforms the text (in my case, converting everything to uppercase — but this could be sentiment analysis, entity extraction, or formatting).

The two nodes are connected so that the LLM feeds directly into the transformation.
